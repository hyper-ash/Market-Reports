By enabling rapid app creation with minimal hand-coding, these platforms have gained traction across industries. But what does the future hold for the market from 2023 to 2033? In this article, we explore the trends and projections that will shape the demand for low-code tools in the coming decade.</p><h2>The Rise of Low-Code Platforms (2018–2022)</h2><p>From 2018 to 2022, the low-code development platforms market grew exponentially. Global businesses, regardless of size, turned to low-code platforms to overcome the skills gap, speed up delivery, and reduce costs. Gartner reported that by 2022, 70% of new applications were being developed with low-code or no-code technologies, an increase from just 25% in 2015. This surge was fueled by the need for digital transformation, especially during the pandemic, when businesses were forced to quickly adapt to remote work and digital engagement.</p><ul> <li><strong>Market Growth:</strong> The global low-code market was valued at around $13.4 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $40 billion by 2025, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.1%.</li> <li><strong>Key Drivers:</strong> Key factors driving the growth included the shift towards cloud-based services, demand for faster time-to-market, and the rising adoption of agile development methodologies.</li> <li><strong>Leading Platforms:</strong> Companies like OutSystems, Mendix, and Appian led the charge, providing platforms that allow users to create complex applications with minimal coding expertise.</li></ul><h2>From 2023 to 2033: Emerging Trends and Market Demand</h2><p>Looking ahead, the LCDP market is expected to continue its robust expansion from 2023 to 2033. However, the market will evolve, with new technologies and changing business needs shaping demand. Here's a breakdown of key trends influencing the low-code landscape in the next decade:</p><h3>1. Increasing Demand for Citizen Developers</h3><p>The rise of "citizen developers" – non-technical users creating applications – will be a major driver. By 2023, it is estimated that more than 75% of large enterprises will have adopted a low-code/no-code development strategy to empower non-developers to build apps. This trend is expected to surge as organizations look to leverage the untapped potential of their existing workforce.</p><h3>2. Integration with AI and Machine Learning</h3><p>Low-code platforms will increasingly integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities. These technologies can help automate repetitive tasks, improve app functionality, and even suggest code improvements, making the development process more efficient. Platforms like Microsoft Power Apps are already exploring AI-powered tools to assist users in building smarter applications.</p><h3>3. Focus on Security and Governance</h3><p>As low-code platforms become more mainstream, concerns around security and governance will rise. From 2023 to 2033, businesses will prioritize security features, such as role-based access control and built-in compliance tools. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 60% of all enterprise applications will be developed using low-code technologies, with stricter security protocols embedded.</p><h3>4. Broader Adoption Across Industries</h3><p>In the coming decade, low-code platforms will be adopted across a broader range of industries, including healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. These industries, traditionally slow to adopt digital transformation, will realize the benefits of low-code platforms in enhancing operational efficiency, reducing costs, and accelerating innovation. The healthcare sector, for instance, is expected to see a surge in low-code use for custom applications to handle patient data management and telehealth services.</p><h3>5. Advanced Automation Capabilities</h3><p>Automation is set to be a game-changer for low-code platforms. By 2030, automation integrated into low-code tools will enable businesses to automatically deploy updates, monitor app performance, and even handle customer service tasks through chatbots and virtual assistants. This will significantly reduce the workload on IT teams and free up resources for more strategic initiatives.</p><h3>6. Expansion into Edge Computing and IoT</h3><p>With the rise of edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), low-code platforms will extend their functionality to these cutting-edge technologies. By 2033, low-code will be at the heart of app development for connected devices, offering easy deployment of applications across IoT networks. Businesses will be able to quickly create apps that interface with IoT sensors, manage data in real-time, and improve operational decision-making.</p></p><p><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Low-Code Development Platforms Software Market Report @ <a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/89068/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=377">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/89068/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=377</a></strong></p><h2>Low-Code Development Platforms Software Market Segmentation Insights</h2><p>The Low-Code Development Platforms Software market is segmented based on key criteria like demographics, geography, product type, application, and end-user, enabling a focused approach for each unique group.
