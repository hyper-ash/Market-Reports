The compound found its way into a variety of products ranging from skincare formulations to dietary supplements, particularly in Asia-Pacific and North America. The surge in demand was further bolstered by:</p><ul> <li><strong>Rising health-consciousness:</strong> A growing focus on holistic health led consumers to seek products rich in essential vitamins like Vitamin B6.</li> <li><strong>Skincare & cosmetic applications:</strong> Pyridoxine Dipalmitate's antioxidant properties were increasingly utilized in cosmetic formulations, especially for anti-aging creams and treatments for sensitive skin.</li> <li><strong>Pharmaceutical use:</strong> Its role in treating Vitamin B6 deficiency also supported the market’s growth during this period.</li></ul><p>The market was also impacted by regional factors. North America led the market, with a rising demand for nutritional supplements and over-the-counter healthcare products.
